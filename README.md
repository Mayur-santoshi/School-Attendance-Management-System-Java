# Student Attendance Management System

## Project Description
The **Student Attendance Management System** is a Java-based application designed to streamline the process of managing attendance records for students. It uses object-oriented principles to provide a robust structure, making it easy to track, update, and maintain attendance data.

## Features
- **Person Management**:
  - Supports the definition of students and other individuals using the `Person` interface.
  - Unique methods like `getId()` and `getName()` for managing personal data.

- **Attendance Management**:
  - Mark attendance for specific dates.
  - Update attendance records.
  - Delete attendance entries.
  - View all attendance data efficiently.

- **Extensibility**:
  - Utilizes interfaces (`Person` and `AttendanceHandler`) and abstract classes to make the system modular and extensible for future enhancements.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Interfaces and Abstract Classes

## File Structure
- `FinalProjectJava.java`: The main file containing the core implementation of the system.
- `package-info.java`: Documentation and metadata about the project package.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the project zip file.
2. Extract the contents and open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
3. Compile and run the `FinalProjectJava.java` file.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a database for persistent storage.
- Addition of a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).
- Role-based access for administrators, teachers, and students.
